# mixed_effects_bootstrapping
Revisiting my QB importance analysis


- This time I'll run an analysis for each random effect separetely and will add the remaining variables of interest as fixed
    - This should help fix the resampling issue (just one random effect at a time)
    - get a random subsample sample?
