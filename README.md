# mixed_effects_bootstrapping
Revisiting my QB importance analysis


- This time I'll run an analysis for each random effect separetely 
    - This should help fix the resampling issue (just retreive random estimate of variable of interest)
- To reduce time, I will a random subsample (maybe 75,000 obs after filtering for useful instances)
